# Basic-RAG
This repository showcases a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to let users upload documents and query them intelligently using an LLM. Once documents are uploaded, they are processed, chunked, and stored in a Vector Database, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information. Users can then ask natural-language questions, and the system responds with context-aware answers generated by the underlying Large Language Model.

The project is built with LangChain for orchestration, Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface, and a VectorDB for efficient similarity search. It demonstrates how to integrate AI models into real applications, manage API keys securely, and build an end-to-end RAG workflow.

Key concepts covered include:

LangChain: for document loading, text splitting, vectorization, and retrieval pipelines.

Streamlit: for creating a clean, intuitive UI that supports file uploads and real-time Q&A.

Vector Databases: for storing document embeddings and performing high-speed semantic search.

RAG Architecture: combining retrieval + generation to produce accurate, context-aware responses.

AI Integration: connecting LLMs with custom datasets to deliver tailored answers.

API Key Management: ensuring secure access to external AI models and services.

This repository is ideal for anyone looking to understand or build a practical RAG system—from developers exploring LangChain workflows to teams wanting to integrate document-based question answering into their applications.
